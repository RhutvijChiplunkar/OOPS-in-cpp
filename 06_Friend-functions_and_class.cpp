/*Friend Class A friend class can access private and protected members of other class in which it is declared as friend. 
It is sometimes useful to allow a particular class to access private members of other class

A friend function can be: 
a) A member of another class 
b) A global function 

* Friendship is not mutual. If class A is a friend of B, then B doesnâ€™t become a friend of A automatically.
* Friendship is not inherited
